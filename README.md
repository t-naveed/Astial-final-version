# [Astia A Smishing Platform](https://it491-astia.streamlit.app/)

You can visit the site but the site is currently defanged means it
has no functionality enabled. So no one can use it for harmful purposes. I have added some screenshots so you can get an overall idea.


This was Capstone Project for my college! 
A Complete and Modern Platform built to enhance cybersecurity awareness training.
Key Features: smishing campaign simulation and documentation of those attacks, Identify employees at risk of social engineering, 
generating comprehensive analytical views.
